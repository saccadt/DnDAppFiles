Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your detination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where the creature was born.</text>
        <text>The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. I fyou take any damaage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with non of you being transported.</text>
