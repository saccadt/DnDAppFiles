        <text>You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you.

		<text>You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron.

Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your detination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where the creature was born.</text>
        <text>The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. I fyou take any damaage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with non of you being transported.</text>
