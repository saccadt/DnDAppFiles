            <text>Travel to The Great Halls of Terrâ€™akkas in Waterdeep will take 10 days from Phandalin (by foot) via the High Road  if PCs stick to the roads. If PCs decide to cut across wilderness it takes 6 days (by foot) with multiple survival checks and more dangerous encounters. Alternative route is via Triboar and the Long Road (by foot, 9 days).</text>
